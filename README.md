# linear
Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.

How Linear Search Works?
Step 1: First, read the search element (Target element) in the array.
Step 2: Set an integer i = 0 and repeat steps 3 to 4 till i reaches the end of the array.
Step 3: Match the key with arr[i].
Step 4: If the key matches, return the index. Otherwise, increment i by 1.
